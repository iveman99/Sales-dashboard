A dynamic and interactive **Sales Dashboard** built in Power BI to analyze business performance across multiple dimensions — including profit, sales, quantity, delivery times, categories, regions, and customer segments.  

This project demonstrates **end-to-end Power BI workflow**: importing, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data with advanced charts, slicers, maps, and forecasting.

## 🔎 Project Purpose
The **Sales Dashboard** was designed to give clear, actionable insights into sales performance.  
It answers key business questions like:
- Which product categories generate the most revenue?  
- What are the profit trends across states and regions?  
- Which shipping modes and payment methods are most preferred?  
- How do monthly sales vary year-over-year?  

This project is useful for **business analysts, sales teams, managers, and students** who want to explore how data-driven insights can improve decision-making.


## 🛠 Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
- 📊 **Power BI Desktop** – for interactive visualizations and dashboard design.  
- 📂 **Excel / CSV** – raw dataset used as the data source.  
- ⚡ **Power Query** – for cleaning, shaping, and transforming the data.  
- 🧠 **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for custom measures, KPIs, and dynamic calculations.  
- 💡 **Learning Resources** – ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, and YouTube tutorials helped guide the process.  


## 📑 Data Source
- **Dataset Files**:  
  - [📂 SuperStore Sales Dataset (CSV)](https://github.com/iveman99/Sales-dashboard/blob/main/SuperStore_Sales_Dataset.csv)  

The dataset includes:
- Product Categories & Sub-Categories  
- Sales, Profit, Quantity  
- Customer Segments & Payment Modes  
- Ship Modes & Delivery Time  
- Regional and State-level performance  

### 🔹 Business Problem
Organizations often struggle to quickly analyze sales patterns across different regions, product categories, and customer segments.  

### 🔹 Goal of the Dashboard
To deliver an interactive **visual analytics tool** that enables:
- Monitoring sales, profit, and quantity KPIs.  
- Analyzing regional and state-level sales with maps.  
- Comparing shipping and payment modes.  
- Understanding customer segments and category contributions.  
- Tracking year-over-year performance.  

### 🔹 Key Visuals in the Dashboard
- **Top KPIs**: Profit, Sales, Quantity, Average Delivery Days  
- **Monthly Sales (YOY)**: Line charts for 2019 vs. 2020 trends  
- **Sales by Region & State**: Interactive map and slicers  
- **Sales by Segment**: Consumer, Corporate, Home Office  
- **Sales by Ship Mode**: Standard, Second, First Class, Same Day  
- **Sales by Payment Mode**: Online, COD, Cards  
- **Sales by Category & Sub-Category**: Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies  

### 🔹 Business Impact & Insights
- **Decision-Making**: Identify best-performing regions and product categories.  
- **Optimization**: Discover less-profitable segments for targeted strategies.  
- **Customer Insights**: Understand segment preferences and payment trends.  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Analyze delivery times and shipping mode performance.
